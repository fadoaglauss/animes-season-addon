Due to this dangerous power, they have been captured and isolated in laboratories by the government. Lucy, a young and psychotic Diclonius, manages to break free of her confines and brutally murders most of the guards in the laboratory where she is being held, only to be shot in the head as she makes her escape. She survives, falling off a cliff into the ocean and manages to drift along to a beach where two teenagers, Kouta and Yuka, discover her. Having lost her memories, she was named after the only thing that she can now say, \"Nyuu,\" and the two allow her to stay at Kouta's home.

Thanks to hentai authors Blue Gale (SPOTLIGHT / PUNISHMENT) and Producers Shiyuuta Biwajima and Chikara Niki (SEX WARD / GIRL NEXT DOOR / HOOLIGAN), you're about to find out! <br><br>\nThe Battle of the Busts! <br><br>\nYusuke has a problem - the kind of problem any guy would love to have. You see, there's this girl named Reina, who wants him to be her \"private tutor\"... oh, and she just happens to have gigantic breasts. Huge, massive, watermelon-sized gazongas that taste sweet and are as soft as marshmallows. <br><br>\nSo, what could Yusuke's problem possibly be? Well, when he goes to Reina's house to give her \"lessons\", he has a run-in with Reina's mom. And boy, is her mom ever stacked. Those triple-F-cup beauties are even bigger than Reina's! Plus, she's got the whole \"sexual mid-life crisis\" going on... she pours it on hot and heavy, and really wants Yusuke to take her for a ride. <br><br>\nStill not seeing the problem? Well each of these lovely ladies wants Yusuke for her own, so when mom catches Yusuke and Reina in the act, the fight is on -and Yusuke's trapped in the middle! Those two may be mother and daughter, but when it comes to winning Yusuke, they'll go to any length to prove their sexual skill! <br><br>\nGood luck ladies, and may the best boobs win! <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB) "

That changed the day he was dunked into a toilet after an attempt to save a classmate from a gang of bullies. Instead of just getting a good soaking, he's pulled in. The next thing he knows, he's in a world that vaguely resembles medieval Europe. If that's not odd enough, he's told that he is to be the next Maoh, just because he has black hair and black eyes. The Maoh is the King of the Mazoku, who are coexisting not-so-peacefully with the humans in this world. Much to his subjects' dismay, he's totally different from the rulers they're accustomed to. He's kind, considerate, a believer in justice, and not willing to use violence to solve conflicts. Not exactly someone they want running a country on the very brink of war. Now, Yuri has to deal with trying to become a good Maoh, while at the same time attempting to adapt to this lands' customs and culture, all in a world where the tension between the humans and Mazoku is reaching its peak.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)"
